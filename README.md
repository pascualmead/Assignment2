Assignment 2

Source Files Submitted:
FileReader.h, FileReader.cpp, Grid.h, Grid.cpp, main.cpp

Problems:
The code still has a lot of bugs but there are parts that work. I had  to spend a long time trying to fix a compiling issue which somewhat set me back. I was unable to figure out the other game modes and was unable to figure out how to stabilize my code. As a result, when the code runs, it will will keep making grids until you manually kill the running program.

*using one late day as well


Instruction on running program:
g++ **.cpp
